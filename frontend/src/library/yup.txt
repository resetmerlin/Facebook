 You can pair Formik with validation libraries like Yup to make the process even simpler

 Yup schemas fulfill several roles as it pertains to the application data. Not only is it performing validation for the form itself (in the React hook form hook configuration), 
 but also to cast data into a usable form in the reducer to then perform manipulation/calculations upon.
